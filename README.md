# Supervised and Unsupervised Learning for Predicting Continuous Well Logs and Lithofacies Identification

## Project Overview

This project applies supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze well log data from the **National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Data Archive**. The goal is twofold:
1. **Predict Continuous Well Logs**: Using supervised learning (SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM), we aim to accurately predict a continuous well log variable based on other log measurements.
2. **Identify Lithofacies Clusters**: Through unsupervised learning, we classify lithofacies, helping to characterize subsurface geology.

## Methodology

The project follows these primary steps:
1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and integrate well log data.
2. **Model Training**: Develop and refine predictive models using supervised learning techniques.
3. **Lithofacies Clustering**: Apply unsupervised learning to reveal geological patterns.
4. **Deployment**: Host the project on GitHub, with project documentation and a GitHub Pages site.
